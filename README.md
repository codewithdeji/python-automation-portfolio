# Python Automation Portfolio

## 🚀 Project 1: Real-Time Crypto Price Alert Bot
**Objective:** The client needed a way to track Bitcoin prices instantly without constantly checking an app.

**Solution:**
I built a Python script that runs 24/7. It connects to the CoinGecko API to fetch live data and sends an instant push notification to the user's phone via Telegram whenever the price updates.

**Key Features:**
* ✅ **Live API Integration:** Fetches real-time market data.
* ✅ **Mobile Alerts:** Uses Telegram Bot API for instant notifications.
* ✅ **Error Handling:** Auto-restarts if the API connection fails.

**How to Run:**
1.  Install dependencies: `pip install requests`
2.  Add your Telegram Token in the configuration section.
3.  Run `python crypto_bot.py`
